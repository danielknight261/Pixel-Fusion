# Project Title

React Feed Frontend Project

This project is a React-based frontend for a feed-style application that showcases a mock interface for managing messages, files, and other user-driven content. It uses a combination of Lucide icons and Font Awesome icons for an aesthetically pleasing design. While not all Font Awesome icons matched the intended design, i took some creative liberties to ensure i got the closest match to the mockup design.

The project is responsive, although there is room for improvement with additional time and testing. Key features include a working search bar, mock login functionality, and a flexible tab-based layout.

## Features

Responsive Design

- The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a functional experience on small and medium screens. Some aspects could benefit from further refinement.

Search Functionality

- The "X" button allows users to reset the search quickly.
- With minimal effort, the search could be extended to include files and other displayed features.

Mock Login System

- Provides a placeholder login/logout experience.
- Enables navigation and interaction with the full app after logging in.

Dynamic Navigation

- Multiple tabs for navigating through the app (e.g., Messages, Files, Notifications).
- Tracks the number of active files dynamically, updating with the search.
- View and delete and download mock files â€” including the delightfully scandalous link to my CV.
- Smooth transitions between sections with mock functionality.
- React with Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

Backend Integration

- Connect to a backend service to enable real data flow, such as fetching messages, files, and user information.

Improved Responsiveness
